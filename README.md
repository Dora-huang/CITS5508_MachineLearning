# MachineLearning
This repository is for unit of CITS5508 machine learning in UWA. <br>
There are some assignments I did during the study period. <br>
The lab2 is about comparing the performance of the two classifiers Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier (SGDC). Besides, it also explores the impact of normalization on the model. The primary results are that the normalization play an important role in building the model and tuning hyperparameters will highly influence the accuracy of models. <br>
There are two parts in the lab3. The first part is to train and evaluate the performance of a Voting classifier. Furthermore, this Voting classifier should comprise three individual classifiers: an SVM classifier, a Logistic Regression classifier and a Gradient Descent classifier. The second part is to investigate the performance of the Random Forest classifier and implement two Random Forest classifiers with different hyperparameter values. <br>
